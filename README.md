# CODECRAFT_DS_01
This repository contains my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at CodeCraft Infotech. The objective of this task was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset and create visualizations to understand the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

# 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the [World_Population-DataSet](worldpopulationdata.csv) , which includes population records from the year 2001 to 2022. It provides valuable insights into population trends over time across different regions.

# 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
🔹 Jupyter Notebook

🔹 Pandas

🔹 NumPy

🔹Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization

# 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA process, the following steps were carried out:

🔹 Data Cleaning : Identified and handled missing values, duplicate records, and outliers to ensure data quality.

🔹 Data Visualization : Created bar charts and stacked charts to visually represent the distribution of categorical and continuous variables in the dataset.

# 🧾 Conclusion
This EDA exercise provided meaningful insights into population distribution trends, serving as a solid foundation for deeper data analysis and predictive modeling in future tasks.
